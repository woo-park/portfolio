              <h4>What project did you decide to join and why?</h4>
              <p>Among Public Participation in Scientific Research(PPSR) citizen science projects, I chose to participate in a project called ARTigo. Before making a commitment to one citizen science project, I asked myself a series of questions. Is this project going to keep me interested? What am I going to gain from participating in this project? In other words, I wanted to know if ARTigo project would keep me actively engaged and the answer was yes.
              </p>
              <p>I decided on ARTigo because it was a straightforward game that did not require a lot of prior knowledge. ARTigo has 8 different games that participants can choose from. The essence of all 8 games is to tag words on an artwork. Each game has a different set of rules, but due to lack of sufficient instructions, the games were little unclear when I first explored them. Another reason why I chose ARTigo was that it seemed like a project that could heighten my level of art and art history knowledge. Because ARTigo games show various kinds of historical artifacts, exploring ARTigo website felt like I was visiting an online museum. Finally, I always wanted to know how meta-data and search engines were created. Currently, ARTigo is focusing a lot on creating a meta-data with the help of participants.
              </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, ARTigo is not simply just a game. It is also a very useful search engine and a tool for finding artworks by using words and description. Thus, it is significant for us, the participants, to actively engage in building ARTigo’s meta-data. With our help (citizen scientists’ contribution), ARTigo will develop into more organized, coherent and practical virtual museum. ARTigo has the potential to become a giant search engine like Google.
              </p>

              <!-- second para -->
              <h4>What are the goals of the project?</h4>
              <p> The main objective of this project is to enhance ARTigo’s database, turning it into an even richer platform. Hence, ARTigo operators have created 8 different ways to collect data on artwork.  In each game, ARTigo asks the users to accurately describe artwork using tags. Tags can be literal and obvious like the ones I have created in Figure1. For example, tags can be as literal as ‘’Woman,’ ‘Man,’ ’Horse,’ ’Dog,’ ’Building,’ etc. Moreover, A user can describe the style of the artwork. For example, they can tag it as a charcoal drawing, an oil painting, or a picture. One can also remark on the color or mood of the artwork. Any word can be used as a tag, but I have discovered that it is always better to be more literal, succinct, and straightforward. The ARTigo team’s major goal would be drawing many participants as possible in order to improve the speed of the database.
              </p>

              <h4>How did it demonstrate the characteristics of citizen science that you explored in this course? 
              </h4>
              <p>I believe the core of citizen science is about participating and exploring what one is interested in. Because of time constraints, some goals cannot be completed by one person. Similarly, ARTigo is a meta-data that cannot be constructed by a few scientists alone. It needs citizen scientists to provide help and support in order for it to thrive.
              </p>
              <p>ARTigo seemed like it is already being supported by many users. One day, I suddenly realized that there were many people playing this game. As you can see in Figure 2, if you click ‘Highscore’, you can see the scores that different users have achieved. As you can see, some are playing as guests, and some have their own profiles. But, the most astounding part was that I was always playing with another player. For instance, whenever I played Karido, ARTigo’s 3rd game, I had to wait for the 2nd player (Figure3). These users might not know that they are the citizen scientists of ARTigo, but undoubtedly, they are helping ARTigo team meet their goals. </p>

              <!-- fourth para -->

              <h4>What was the science of this project?  In terms of knowledge and practices, what science did you learn from participating in this project? </h4>
              <p>Although the name ARTigo gives the impression that the project is more closely related to art history than science, the core of this project is built upon science. Citizen scientists are asked to create data for the ARTigo team. Despite it being the team’s job to analyze and interpret data, it is our job to create as much data as possible on a given piece of artwork. Our job is not as simple as it might sound. For a given artwork, we come up with descriptions that most accurately describe it. Depicting artwork is a meticulous job and also a time-consuming task. We are also unaccustomed to seeing the artwork that was made centuries ago.
              </p>
              <p>From participating in creating a meta-data, I realized how important is to collect data that isn’t necessarily numbers related. If we look at Boyler’s citizen science notes, data is compiled with descriptions that Boyler experienced during experiments.  This project allowed me to think more broadly about data, and unravel its misconception.
              </p>



              <!-- fifth para -->
              <h4>Describe what you were required to do in order to be a participant in this project. What question were you exploring and what sort of evidence did you generate as a participant to be able to answer that question? </h4>
              <p>Even though the learning curve was not steep, there were some things that I had to explore on my own before I could really delve into the project. One of the difficulties that I faced was figuring out how the point system worked. On the webpage, under the ABOUT ARTIGO section, it informs the users on basic rules of the game. It explains that black tags are 0 points because the tag is new to the artwork, dark blue tags are 25 points because a player and their co-player both entered the same tags, and light blue tags are 5 points because the tag has been used in previous games. Before finding this set of instructions, I did not know why some tags were worth 25 points and some were 0 points. On the other hand, I think this point system prevented users from coming up with more creative descriptions. For some reason, despite there being no reward for scoring higher points, I tried to enter tags that were extremely straightforward (such as nose, lips, ears, eyes, and face) (Figure 4 & Figure 5). My question was: What happens if I enter a tag that is more creative and abstract, using adjective descriptions (Figure 6). I was unable to find out what kind of contribution I was making when I depicted the artwork with words ‘Sad,’ ‘Gloomy,’ ‘Cringing,’ and ‘Cyan.’ However, it was evident that I collected fewer points when I used descriptions that are less literal.

              <h4>Provide examples over time as evidence of your involvement. How does your citizen science log capture this process? </h4>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, ARTigo has eight games. After exploring each of them, I found ARTIGO GAME the most engaging.
              </p>
              <p>
              How the ARTIGO GAME is played: When a user enters the game, an image of artwork comes up to the screen. A different artwork appears in each time, and I have never experienced in seeing the same artwork showing up again. The game has five rounds once the player starts the game. The player collects points based on the tags that they enter. Players have 60 seconds to submit as many tags as possible before moving on to the next round. In other words, as the player increases the number of tags, the player has a higher chance of acquiring more points. While playing the game, participants can also see how many tags co-players have entered in. After going through 5 rounds, participants can see the artists, titles, locations, dates, scores and entered tags of the artwork they engaged with. However, I will make a note of the fact that the website is poorly designed. In order to see the names of artists, titles, locations and etc, a player has to click through 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 7).  It would have been a much better User Experience (UX) if a player could immediately view all the information of all the artwork at a glance without having to click-through and search for artwork’s information.
              </p>

            </a>
              </figure>

              <p>Understanding the point system: When I first played this game, I was unsure of what kinds of descriptions(data) ARTigo project was looking for. But, as I spent more time playing, I realized what the ARTigo organizers were trying to accomplish (their goal) and what types of raw data that the developers were looking for. There was a reason why the game was constructed with a point system. The point system allowed the participants to narrow down the boundless-possible tags into accurate-literal tags. If you look at my logs, the way I describe artwork has changed from very loose and open-ended descriptions into very concise and literal descriptions. In this way, due to the point system, I earned a lot more points despite that they were collectives of 5 light blue tags. In addition, occasionally, some of the light blue tags turned into dark blue tags because my co-player was also tagging the same word. In other words, I had a better chance of obtaining higher scores by thinking less and expressing more direct descriptions. My realization was this: ARTigo is looking to collect data that is more objective than subjective.

              <p>Let’s look at Figure 8 and Figure 9: Figure 8 was done when I first encountered ARTigo game. Figure 9 was done after many hours of playing ARTigo. If you compare them side by side, you can notice the number of tags that I entered in Figure 9. In addition, in Figure 8, I collected 295 points on round 5 of 5 whereas I collected I collected 220 points on round 2 of 5. The points are cumulative until round 5.

              <p>I did not take screenshots every time I played ARTigo games because that was not the objective for me in participating in ARTigo. However, I captured as many screenshots as I could so that a new participant can find them beneficial in case one struggles to be a citizen scientist of ARTigo. If one is interested in playing ARTigo games, one should definitely create an account first because, under the ‘Highscore’ section, players can see their monthly high scores and daily high scores. As you can see in Figure11, many are playing as guests, which is what I also did until I figured this out. In Figure 11, I was placed 5th on November with 3135 high-score.

              <h4>What were your achievements? </h4>
              <p>Like other citizen science projects that develop and increase ability in skills like identifying organisms, ARTigo helped me develop an ability to describe artworks in the most accurate terms. Over time, I was able to put up with more tags within the same limitation of 60 seconds. I became better at interpreting artwork and finding hidden clues from an artwork. From playing, comparing artworks, and tagging words, I became part of ARTigo meta-data. Lastly, ARTigo allowed me to witness artworks that I would have never seen or known in my life. I became a fan of some of the paintings and sculptures and took some screenshots so that I can use them as a collection of references in the future.
              </p>

              <!-- eightpara -->
              <h4>Use Bonney (2009) posted to Resources in NYU Classes to identify the type of citizen science project into which you would classify the project you studied.
              </h4>
              <p>  According to Public Participation in Scientific Research: Defining the Field and Assessing Its Potential for Informal Science Education, we can define ARTigo project as a contributory project. This is the first model out of three models, contributory project, collaborative projects, and co-created projects. In ARTigo, players are primarily asked to contribute piling data, and the protocols are designed by scientists and engineers. Players are asked to analyze the raw data, instead of analyzing the refined data. We interpret the raw data(art images) so that the ARTigo organizers can use the refined data(tags) to create meta-data.
              </p>

              <h4>What are some recommendations you have for the developers of this project? </h4>
              <p>The games are well designed, but the website looks like a webpage from the early 2000s. My recommendation would be to create a better User Interface(UI) and User Experience (UX) because after all, this is an interactive project that requires a lot of engagement from participants. However, the current website is hard to navigate through. I also think the project needs a better set of guidelines; thus, people don’t have to spend too much time trying to understand the main objective of the game and the game rules. Since ARTigo developers’ main goal is to collect data, it would be great if they could inform the users like what types of tags(data) they are looking for, instead of leaving everything on participants to figure out (like how I explored ARTigo).
              </p>

              <h4>How did this experience of citizen science compare with what you are doing in class as part of this course? 
              </h4>
              <p>The experience from ARTigo was not quite the same as the experience I had from class experiments. I believe that is mainly due to the fact that ARTigo is a contributory project, which I have less control of the project. In class experiments, because I get to both observe the raw data and analyze that data, class experiments taught me more. On the other hand, I understand that the experiment I have done in class is not as accurate as the experiments done by a collective group. ARTigo game and the hands-on experiments are similar in a way that it required me to be an active participant. Yet, I wish that ARTigo was willing to provide more information about the collected meta-data that the ARTigo players contribute.
