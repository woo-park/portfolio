            <p>I could never understand why people go to a coffee shop or even understand what makes drinking coffee so special. It wasn’t until I became a fan of coffee that I came to understand the symbolic and social implications that a cup of coffee represents. In the culture I grew up in, the act of drinking coffee is also an everyday custom as well as representing social status.
            </p>

            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I could never understand why people are willing to spend time sitting, chatting, and working at a coffee shop instead of somewhere else. This was before I became a regular coffee drinker. I felt like going to a coffee shop would have been more understandable if today’s coffee houses were like the ones in London during 17th century. When the coffee house first became a part of people’s lives, the coffee shop served as a place where people could actively engage in talking to one another. Different kinds of political opinions and innovative ideas were discussed by the customers at the coffee shop. The coffee shop not only served as a center where public opinions flourished, but also a place where the commoners(peasants) and aristocrat-like elites could gather to converse without class distinctions restricting them -- the public sphere claimed by a German sociologist Jürgen Habermas.
            </p>

            <p>These active and lively coffee houses have somewhat diminished over the centuries. I will say a little more about my personal experience at today’s coffee shops. When I go to a coffee shop, I usually go alone. From what I have observed, people at coffee shops are busy living their own lives: working on laptops, reading papers, and talking to friend that they came in with. I seldom see two strangers start conversing, and when they do discuss, they rarely talk in depth. It is no longer an area to discuss the current political issues, nor an area where valuable knowledge is exchanged. The type of conversation that takes place in coffee house has changed. This is mainly due to the fact that the coffee shop has become highly commercialized and commodified.
            </p>

            <p>How can a coffee shop itself can be commercialized or commodified when, in fact, it is a place that sells commodities? Coffee shops, for instance Starbucks, is selling the experience of the place as well as selling a cup of coffee. Today’s Starbucks is not just about providing a coffee, but also about providing a fabricated space to customers. Other than a cup of coffee, Starbucks sell bags of coffee beans, stainless steel bottles, mugs, chemexs (pour-over kit), bottled water, chocolate bars, salads, and sandwiches. They sell the experience, that is “feeling” or vibe to the customers as soon as they walk into their stores.
            </p>

            <p>Starbucks is one of the most successful enterprises in the world. In New York, there are 317 Starbucks stores and 223 in Manhattan. What does this tell us? Starbucks, that was started from Seattle by one advertiser and two school teachers, has transformed into a corporation that dominates the coffee shop industries. Like any other company competing in the neoliberal market, Starbuck’s main goal in their marketing strategy is to make profits. Thus, it is important to look at their target audience because that is where money is collected from: the bourgeois middle class.
            </p>

            <p>Although coffee shops have changed over the years, the target audience has remained the same. When a coffee shop served as an outlet for “public” opinions, this “public” did not include the poor, laborers, immigrants, and women. The public sphere, which is supposedly encompassing all citizens, in fact was not actually a sphere for all the public. There was discrimination and various requisites to fit in the circle of patrons for the coffee shops. The coffee shops excluded females. It was the ideal public sphere for the male bourgeois middle class. Yes, it allowed and provided opportunities for those who did not attend university to learn and to discuss freely with the elites; however, these opportunities still came with a price: money, time, social status, and gender. Today’s coffee shop goers has broadened, including women in the public sphere (coffee shop). However, the target audience is still the bourgeois middle class, exempting the poor and labourers. Thus, coffee shops are mainly visited by the middle-class consumers who have spare time to be at coffee shops.
            </p>

            <p>As Sonia Bookman mentioned in <i><u>Branded Cosmopolitanisms: 'Global' Coffee Brands and the Cocreation of 'Cosmopolitan Cool</u></i>, some people felt reluctant to pay $4 for a latte, while some were willing to spend that money in compensation for the experience. As Starbucks intended, people are addicted to the “feeling” that the Starbucks stores provide. The experience of Starbucks begins with a process of choosing a cup of coffee from the humongous menu board on the wall. Consumers are provided with many options to choose: from latte, cappuccino, frappuccino to espresso. When they do finally choose one of these Italian named coffees, they are once again asked to choose from “tall”, “grande”, and “venti”. Some consumers, who are not familiar with these names of different sized cups, will just say small or medium. (At first, I thought tall was a large sized cup of coffee.) After a consumer gets a coffee or any beverage from the bar, one needs to choose where to sit, which varies from wooden chairs, metal stools, to leathered sofas. Some Starbucks have a large wooden antiquey-looking table. The counter and shelves are filled with different regional coffees such as Nicaragua, Peru and Colombia. And above their head, they will see the world-wide map that they use to make marks on the geographies that Starbucks “fairly-trade” coffee beans from. The whole environment is decorated in an urban style, filled by the Starbucks’ selected jazz, and depicted as an ideal world. Starbucks depicts itself as a world where safety is granted as a peaceful “3rd home”.
            </p>

            <p>It is mind-boggling that I also see the coffee shops as “3rd home”. A place I can be more relaxed and more productive than in my own room. The demarcation between private space of a home and the public space of a coffee shop has blurred. A coffee shop is a public space, yet it provides the sense of private space. Even more ironically, this public space is privately owned by another entity.
            </p>

            <p>The last note I want to make is that this 3rd home sensation is highly romanticized. Referring coffee shops as a public sphere is also highly romanticized. The coffee shop does not fulfill the “imagined community” that Benedict Anderson speaks of. It seems to function as the ideal place, but that is the presumed perception of a coffee house because coffee houses are not accessible for all. A cup of coffee that is $4 is not affordable for all. The coffee house is no longer a place where social engagement occurs. Instead, the coffee house has transformed into private spaces for individuals. Coffee shop customers need to acknowledge that coffee houses depicted as a public space “for all” people is an assumption.
