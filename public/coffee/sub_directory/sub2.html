            <p> What pops-up first in our minds when we hear the term “fair-trade”? Does it literally mean a trade that is performed fairly between the producer and the buyer? Or does it mean that the consumer pays a minimum price so that some money goes directly into the producers’ pockets. In fact, this last is only partially right. Fair-trade does not solely mean that paying with a minimum price will sustain lives in producing countries. The effect of fair trade should not be limited in thinking of a single price agreement between two parties. Fair-trade aims to bring multiple positive effects to the lives of 3rd world countries. In other words, the effect of fair-trade should not be considered as a singular effect, but as in plural one.
            </p>

            <p>	Before we look at several potential effects of fair-trade on lives in 3rd world, we must understand what makes fair-trade so appealing to both customers and companies. Since colonial times in South America, the economic structures of South American countries have been deeply intertwined with the markets in the North America and European countries. Even after the colonialization of Latin America was over, for almost a half of century, Latin American countries have been dependent on trading raw commodities like coffee beans, sugar, and cotton to other developed countries, and thus the gap continuously expanded between the developed and the under-developed countries. As the power dynamic in the trading relationship skewed and favored the developed countries, the underdeveloped countries suffered, especially the small peasant farmers. Noticing this imbalance in the commodity exchange process, the ideal approach, fair-trade surfaced in the market. Fair trade was intended to provide the small/powerless farmers some opportunities to sell their crops because the small farmers could not compete against the larger farmers who sold, for instance, coffee beans at much cheaper prices. Because fair trade eliminated many intermediaries who stood between the producer and the consumer, purchasing fairly-traded products heightened the sense of helping, supporting, and contributing to the lives of poor producers.
            </p>

            <p>A company that advertises running a fair-trade program is Starbucks. Starbucks’ brand is very tightly wrapped around with a socially and environmentally responsible image. Grabbing a cup of Starbucks coffee can be more meaningful to customers than purchasing from some unheard-of coffee shop. Nowadays, purchasing from Starbucks has the power to make customers feel better about themselves for several reasons. First, Starbucks accentuates of their accomplishment in the fair-trade businesses. Second, Starbucks advertises their social responsible commitment to help the poor countries. Third, Starbucks portrays themselves as one of the pioneers in the fair-trade movement. But, is Starbucks really helping many communities in Latin America and in Africa as they claim? In 2004, Starbucks bought only 3.7% fairly-traded beans out of many beans that Starbucks purchased. In 2006 and 2007, Starbucks only imported 6% fairly-traded beans out of all imported beans. In 2012, it imported 8.1% fairly-traded beans. Nonetheless, on their packaging, they speak as if all their beans are fairly-traded. For consumers, Starbucks was simply lying, but for the bean producers, they were asked for another challenge: demanding higher standard of production of coffee.
            </p>

            <p>Because the requirements that Starbucks demanded were very high standard beans as well as some ideal environments, many poor small farmers had to re-invest in making their farm look better, even though they were not making profits. When the time came for Starbucks to evaluate coffee farms, since Starbucks only picked a handful farms out of many applied farms, Starbucks graded each farm from 1 to 100 based on whether the farm portrayed the image that Starbucks wanted to show to their consumers. This scoring and evaluating program is called Starbucks’ CAFÉ Practice. If the image of a farm reflected their brand image, Starbucks agreed to pay at a tiny bit higher price than other beans while the majority/the rest of the farmers had gained nothing in return for investing in improving their farm conditions. The evaluation was conducted yearly. Poor farmers have been put into this cycle to improve their farm every year with a hope of making partnership with Starbucks which then only lasted for a year. A transnational company, Starbucks, is putting the poor farmers in a much more vulnerable position because they have to stretch themselves in order to meet the level that Starbucks asks for. Starbucks cares more about benefiting with trades than the farmers themselves. We must not forget that profit is Starbucks’ number one priority just like other companies. Lastly, the balance of power remains the same between the rich and the poor.

            <p>Fair-trade is supposed to lessen the unequal power relationship of the powerful and the weak. A consumer who receives the commodity after a payment has no clue of what price the commodity was paid for. The fair-trade label does not guarantee delivering extra money to the fair-trading producers. The label has become an emblem that only attracts customers’ attention, and thus, many transnational companies signed up for fair-trade like Nestle, Sara Lee, Procter & Gamble, even when companies only practice 3% fair-trade of their whole trading.
            </p>

            <p>The fair-trade movement carries positive connotation for consumers. Knowing this, transnational companies tried to tie their brand images with the movement’s positive image. The large companies wanted fair-trade certificates because acquiring a label was an easy way to cover up their original trading practices, and then replace it with the humane, ethical, and caring image: the fair-trade label. On the other hand, coincidently, the Fair-trade Labelling Organizations International organization(FLO) was also looking for a way to widely inform the fair-trade practice to citizens. FLO figured that giving the certificate to large companies would raise many consumers’ awareness of the living conditions in the 3rd world. Well, this was the original goal that the FLO pursued, but it did not have the result that they hoped for.
            </p>

            <p>The meaning of fair trade has been altered by the actions of FLO and large transnational companies. This was partially because these companies have stronger power than that of the FLO organization, but was also partially due to the profit motive of the organization. FLO was seeking for profit like any other marketing company when the non-profit organization should have stood firmly in a neutral position, controlling and regulating the companies. Although the aim of FLO is to further spread the perception of “fair trade,” FLO has altered, falsified, and maneuvered the core definition of fair-trade.
            </p>

            <p>
            We must acknowledge that fair trade can be a double-edged sword for the producers. The fair- trade label and participating (barely) in fair trade can both ease a few farmers’ lives and exacerbate the problems of many farmers’ lives. With the costs of living rising and the higher demands imposed by the importers, producers are facing another dilemma. It is a major dilemma because either way they are not profiting or benefiting from fair trade. It is a dilemma between getting paid around $1.49/pound and re-investing all the profits in improving coffee beans, or getting paid around $0.86/pound and purchasing a little bit of other necessity goods.
            </p>

            <p>One of the reasons that fair-trade did not result in tangible improvements to small farmers is that fairly-traded commodities are still dependent on consumers’ desires, like other non-labeled commodities. The fair-trade movement is still focused around the consumer and the large companies in the attempt to satisfy desires of the people of developed countries. The focus has to be shifted mainly on environment, economic structure and the lives of small farmers. Lastly, because there are demands from companies and expectations from consumers of the high-quality beans in fair-trades, the small farmers cannot avoid the extra burdens. The unequal power relationship between consumers and producers remains.
