            <p>After reading <i><u>The Rise of Yuppie Coffees and the Reimagination of Class in the United States</u></i> by William Roseberry and <i><u>World on a Plate</u></i> by Ian Cook and Philip Crang made me realize that my act of searching single-origin coffee is a double commodity fetishism.
            </p>

            <p>Everyday, I walk across countless of people holding coffee in their hands. Drinking coffee has become integral part of my generation as well. A cup of coffee has become a habitual practice. At least mine is. But over several decades, the way people consume coffee has changed. People of my generation prefer to drink americano, latte, cappuccino, and etc from coffee shops instead of instant coffee from a machine or a plastic packet. People are seeking for some quality coffees over quantitative coffees, and some even ask for single-origin coffees (also known as specialty line coffee) at coffee shops, like me. For instance, when I asked for what kinds of single-origin coffees that they have, the employee listed different geographies such as Columbia, Brazil, Kenya, and etc. And I ordered coffee beans that interested me the most based on their names. This consumer behavior of mine is a commodity fetishism because I had no whatsoever knowledge about the region that I selected; however, I chose that particular geographical coffee beans because it appealed to me the most.
            </p>

            <p>Now that I have learned a little about the production, distribution, and marketing of coffee beans, I find myself ashamed of my previous behaviors. Now that I know some troublesome aspects of the coffee bean commodity, let me introduce the political aspects of it before you walk out to buy another cup of coffee.
            </p>

            <p>I encourage everyone, who drinks coffee, to ask themselves of the processes and labour power exchanged in order for them to have the coffee experience available. As David Harvey mentioned, when consumers are purchasing commodities, they pay with money without considering the labour processes and social relations of the commodities. And vice versa, when companies are selling commodities, companies don’t bother to mention about the production processes and labours put on making the commodity. As a result, not many of us give a dam* about the labour conditions concealed behind the price tag of many commodities. Have you ever wondered how much a worker at the coffee farm is paid when you buy cup of coffee for $4 or $5? The price a customer pays for a cup at the coffee shop is around 400% to 600% of a price that is paid for a worker at the coffee farm. Yet, many of us buy coffee with slightest knowledge of coffee, mostly on the effects of caffeine, and we never ponder about the political questions that coffee beans raise. Also, we have to understand the meaning of coffee beans from the perspective of the culture or geography where they come from. Single-origin coffees are the examples of cultural objectification. We, as customers, are simply fascinated by the emphasized geography and differentiated quality of “single-origin” coffee, but we never think about what coffee means to the labourers working in coffee farm.
            </p>

            <p>To understand when and why we are all of sudden intrigued by these geographically accentuated commodities, we have to look at the consumer world. A consumer world is shaped by the marketers. Because our generations are no longer interested in quantity goods, but rather on quality goods, marketer’s strategy was to make a differentiated product from the standardized goods. For example, the instant coffee was the standardized and homogeneous product that had been popular, but because young generations wanted products that are special or different, marketers thought to objectify both the culture and geography into a commodity: specialty line coffee. We are also accustomed to cultural mixing known as ‘cultural diffusions’ by the marketers and traders. Nowadays, people are convinced to believe that our world has become such a smaller and a compact world. A world is viewed as where everyone with different background can meet and where different cultures exist in one place. However, while the cultural differences are emphasized in this global post-modern world, many cultures are also reconstructed in the ways that we want to look at.

            <p>The images of commodities portrayed to our society is heavily influenced by the market system. And we are accustomed to want these commodities. Purchasing products have become almost a routine, and doing so often satisfies us. In order to comprehend this craving-behavior, we need to scrutinize some of the values that are embedded in the commodities. Coffee, for instance, is a commodity that customers trade with another form of commodity, known as money. We complete this exchange with coffeeshop because we are interested in attaining the value coffee contain. However, the problem is that the value we want as a consumer and the value of coffee that the large coffee companies want are different.
            </p>

            <p>According to Marx, all commodities have two kinds of values. We can distinguish coffee beans into these two values, use-value and exchange value. A use-value for cup of coffee would be the effect that shows on people when they consume coffee. For some people, coffees are used as stimulant. On the other hand, coffee has exchange values as well, which is what mainly drives corporations to continuously produce and sell coffee beans. In the old days, money initially served and functioned as a yardstick that measures the value of a product. So, money was the exchange rate that allowed two commodities to be traded fairly and in equivalent values. In the circulation of commodities, money was just a tool that meddled between two commodities (commodity – money – commodity). However, as people seek for profits in this circulation of commodities, people invested money to make more capital (money). So, under this capitalist trading system, it looked like this: money – commodity – money. Again, the main objective from the commodity circulation in capitalist world is a profit. And this phenomenon is what causes many problems.
            </p>

            <p>Because firms’ primary goals are to make profits, they are focusing on the quantity rather than quality. And one reason these firms can’t help themselves from walking away in this business model is due to the fact that this capitalist society is reliant on the exchange value more than the use-value.
            </p>

            <p>Since the money seizes the main spotlight, the notion of labour is concealed when the commodities are exchanged, meaning when a commodity is sold. We are blinded by the monetary value, especially the large corporations who puts their profit before workers’ working conditions, fair wages, and healths.
