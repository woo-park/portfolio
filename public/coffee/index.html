            <p>	<span class = "capital">W</span>e all know about some knowledge about the effect of coffee once the caffeine is engulfed into our bodies. Due to coffee’s special trait, coffee played a significant role in 20th century. It was more than just a beverage that suddenly became very popular amongst citizen. First, coffee replaced beer which had been the established and accustomed drink during the period. Coffee was unique in a sense that it neither made a person intoxicated nor harm a person. It was rather considered as a medicine when it was first introduced to Europeans. In addition, the caffeine from the coffee beans awakened people when their brain’s nervous system sent signals that one should rest. Some held opposing view against the newly adopted beverage coffee, and they perceived coffee as the evil drink because it sucks out fluid from people’s body. However, coffee had another dark and evil sides along with the effectual side of coffee. But, before we discuss about the behind stories of coffee bean trades, lets take a look at some positive changes brought to European cultures.
            </p>
            <p>  The impacts of coffee beverage had brought on to Europe, in countries like England, Holland, Spain, and Portugal, were significant economically, culturally, and sociologically. For instance, in England, men were both sharply awakened and stimulated so that they spent most of their times at the coffee shops. And when they returned home, they smelled like coffee mixed with tabacos. Coffee house was also known as the Penny University due to knowledge and information that were given and received between people with a entrance fee of penny to the coffee shop. One of the coffee shop had turned into stock exchange market, and the another into news corporation. Also, political concepts like secret ballot were discussed. Because a coffee shop had become a very popular place to meet, people’s lives were adjusting into having more coffees everyday. Nonetheless, as European countries were undergoing through cultural shifts due to extensive demand of coffee beans, many countries on the other side of the world were also changing. In other words, while Europeans bought many cups of coffees to make to nourish their lives, countless numbers of people were hand-picking coffee berries at the coffee plantation. As the demand grew, the number of hired workers also had to grew.  Nevertheless, the problem was that because the dean had been so excessive in short period of time, people began to use slaves to fulfill the supply and demand market.

            <p>Coffee business took off extremely fast once all the Europeans’ countries began to participate in coffee trades. What allowed coffee to instantly become part of Europeans’ everyday lives are the plantations that have already been built in Central America. In Central America, the sugar plantations were already established. And more slaves were sent every week to the plantations from Africa. Since the European colonialism, slaves were used by plantation owners to maximize profits. Coffee bean trade followed the exact same path that sugar trade had created because of obsessive demands and egoistic desires for profits. The beans had been the new commodity that people fanatically looked for. As a result, the beans fostered the slave trade.

            <p>When we purchase a commodity, we are likely to think about an appearance or a value of the product. Our first impression or attention is less likely to be on how it got there, but instead on something else. However, it is crucial to ask oneself how it is manufactured, where it is made, and by whom it is packaged. Because many products are often manufactured overseas, we often put aside the process of products being created from our thoughts. The imagery of factories with thick concrete walls doesn’t help people to see the poor working environment that laborers suffer in. We assume as if the products are presented to our hands without the processes of manufacturing, distributing, and packaging. In fact, the products could have been put together by some underpaid workers. These are some of the current issues that are still occurring out in many unknown factories. A commodity should be fairly traded, minimum waged must be promised and working environment must be protected. And there should be no more bystanders letting egoistic owners get away with it.

            <!-- <p>In speaking of plantation and factories, there are many workers in Jamaica who spend their whole day packaging papayas. Papayas are tropical fruit that Jamaica has become well known for. Jamaica’s fresh papayas are exported to England, and when a consumer purchases the fruit from a grocery market, one looks for a fresh papaya. The problem is that if one finds it, one takes for granted. However, the stories behind the fresh papayas are awful like the coffee beans in 19th century. 300J is a month salary for packaging worker. When it is converted, it is 2.4 US dollars. According to one of the worker, she can barely afford to buy a cloth with the salary. Packaging papayas is laborious and time-consuming work. And one must finish packing certain numbers of boxes in order to return home. Moreover, in this working area, the supervisor’s office is positioned five feet up at the end of the packaging house, providing higher vantage point to surveil on workers. This is similar to the meat packing industry that Timothy Pachirat wrote in Every Twelve Seconds: Industrial Slaughtered and the Politics of Sight. In this meat packing factory, supervisors are positioned also on the 2nd floor office which has windows that could look down on to the 1st floor where workers are. In this factory, supervisors could also look at the screen monitors that are linked up with many surveillance cameras to see workers’ diligent hands. </p> -->
