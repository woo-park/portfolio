            <div class="div2">
                <main>
                    <div id="intro">
                      <h3>What Is Guess The Correlation?</h3>
                      <p>My citizen science project is called "Guess The Correlation." First of all, my project is a very straight forward and simple web-based game. The only thing that the player is asked for is to guess the correlation of the scattered plot. The scatter plot changes every round, and they are truly random. When the player's guess is close to the true correlation number, the player is rewarded with coins. The guess of the correlation is limited from 0.0 to 1.0. So, let's get started! </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="purpose">
                      <h3>Purpose</h3>
                      <p> Although the game seems very random and you may wonder what is the point of playing this game, this game is in fact designed with a purpose. This game falls under a category named 'Human-Based Computation Game' or 'Game With A Purpose(GWAP).' This type of game was first designed by Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University. The idea is to use human brainpower to solve problems that cannot be tackled by computers.
                      In Guess The Correlation, designed by Omar Wagih of the European Bioinformatics Institute, it's purpose is to gather data on how humans perceive scattered plots. As I participated in this project, I learned that the way I perceive the correlation of the graph is often skewed and perceived differently than the true correlation.

                    <div id="two_column">
                      <div id="importance">
                        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                        <p> It is important to participate in this type of game because the project is gathering data on how humans perceive a graph. Because this is specific to how humans think, data cannot be modeled and computed without our participation.</p>
                      </div>

                      <div id="entertaining">
                        <h3>What makes it entertaining?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. The rewarding system keeps the participant continuously playing. The score the player obtains is stored in the local-storage; therefore, as long as the player doesn't clear the cookies or local storage, the player's highest score will remain on the game site. Also, there is a scoreboard where it shows the top 10 scores. </p>
                      </div>



                    </div>

                    <div id="goal">
                      <h3>Goal</h3>
                      <p>My goal was to get my score on the scoreboard. By the time I promised myself of this goal, 30 points were my highest score. As of now, I have 103 points. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="learning">
                      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>  Although the game seems very straightforward and easy, there is a gradual learning curve throughout the game. As I explained above, the rules are simple. However, unless the player has some experience in retrieving the correlation of a graph, the player has to experience which graph resembles a correlation of 0.7 or 0.2. </li>
                        <li>Some questions I thought of when I first encountered this game:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Is it a pure guessing game?</li>
                            <li>Is there a better way to guess the correlation?</li>
                            <li>What are the numbers on the x-coordinate and y-coordinate represent?</li>
                            <li>Again, is there any way you can compute the correlation on my own?</li>
                            <li>How many points are plotted? Is it always the same?</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div id="game_design">
                      <h3>Game Design</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The game is very user-friendly. The player simply has to click "New Game" to begin, and give a temporary user name. From then on, the player can guess the number with the keyboard and then press 'enter' to check the answer. However, the player has to click the 'play again' button in order to play the game again. I wish there was another convenient keyboard shortcut that will grant the user to restart the game right away because after all, the game needs as much as participation and contribution as possible.</li>
                        <li>
                        The game has a rewarding system where it sometimes gives 5 coins and sometimes gives 1 coin to the user. The number of coins given varies, but they are rewarded only when the difference of the player's guess and the true correlation is less than 1. </li>
                        <li>It only takes in a number between 0.0 to 1.0. In other words, it prevents the user from injecting texts other than anticipated numbers.</li>
                      </ol>

                            I realized something really important after studying how to boost up my score. I found out that the true correlation of the graph is rarely an integer. However, all of these times, I have been guessing with integers like 2.0, 6.0 and 9.0. The true correlations were almost always floating numbers. So, I began guessing the number with more specific numbers such as 0.95, 0.83, 0.12, and so on. </li>
                            <li>
                            As soon as I tried this tactic, I started collecting more coins. My guessed answer was actually getting closer to the true answer. But at the same time, it required more time to look at the graph and speculate the number. (It also increased the number of times the guessed number is off.)
                            </li>
                            <li>On day 44, I had the highest score and also got 100% correct twice in that run. From then on, I engaged the game with more specific values, intentions, and goals.</li>

                      <h3>Tie it back to Citizen Science</h3>
                      <p>
                        What is citizen science? It is collective experimentation that is constructed based on curiosities and interests, unlike some science that "tries to squeeze the economic juice from scientific research" (Citizen Scientist, 10). Science has been very crucial part of our lives until now and it will not only continue to be the core but also continue to shape our lives. However, recently, as it is mentioned in Citizen Scientists, scientific researches done by scientists are often conducted due to an economical reason rather than due to an interest of their own. With their efforts, we are able to experience new innovations in our everyday lives. Yet, as a part of citizen scientists, we are here to argue that this isn't enough. Science is not an expertise that scientists can only practice. For many centuries, citizens have practiced and participated in science without a title named 'scientist,' and this was the key that led to creative innovations. (not some economic value)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                         We still need people who will devote all of their time and mind, as their profession, scientists. However, we need people who are willing to participate in their research to grow and thrive. Science will thrive even more when science is "built from the bottom up." Participation matters in any type of research because most of the assumptions are shaped by a large pool of data. The diversity and disagreement found in the data are what produce an accurate result. Thus, we need more assistance from the citizens and work as a collective group.

                          Like many other citizen science projects, Guess The Correlation has helped me understand and also how to interpret a scattered plot. When I first encountered the game site, it seemed complicated, but it was not. I became better at interpreting and actively guess the number. For instance, I played this game with a friend. We both guessed the correlation number and shared our predicted numbers to each other. It turned out that my guesses were a lot closer to the true correlation value since I have had more practice than my friend.  To reiterate, because I had been exposed to these types of scattered plots, I was able to retrieve past experiences and memories and use that to make better guesses.
